# Final ITI project intake 42
This project provision an ec2 on aws and configure to run minikube to function as a a single-node kubernetes cluster, deploy a nodejs app and install nginx to function as a reverse-proxy.\
Follow the Steps section to run this project.

## Prerequisites

1. Create an aws iam user with programmatic access. Run the following command to access the aws and create resources
```
aws configure
```
2. Create a S3 bucket to be used to store the terraform state file and enable versioning. Add the name of the S3 bucket to the main.tf file in the Minikube-Infra directory.
3. Create a Dynamodb table named iti-final-task with partition key named LockID of type String.



## Steps to Deploy the application
1. Clone the the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:sambo2021/ITI-Final-Task.git
```
2. Build infrastructure, run provisioner on EC2 to run minikube and nginx as a reverse proxy, deploy jenkins and nexus resources on the k8s cluster.
```
./Build.sh
```












- to build infrastructure, connect to remote minikube, deploy jenkins and nexus resources ->  ./Build.sh
- open jenkins by ec2 ip and set user name and password, then download kubernetes plugin and configure a cloud node of kubernetes as per kink number 1 
- then add config file taht downloades locally by script as secret file on jenkins using id mykubeconfig
- dont forget to restart jenkins 
- open nexus at ec2-ip/nexus and set username and password *the same user name and password as secret.tf in ./Kubernetes-Resources* and create docker hosted repo at http port 8082 
- back to jenkins and create a job of pipline by this repo link and Jenkinsfile
- then you can access your application at ec2-ip/app  
- to destroy the whole infrastructure->  ./Destroy.sh 
- to know how we build the docker file inside kaniko container see Link number 2 
- and to know prequesities that we had done of config file and kubernetes node cloud on jenkins see Link nunber 3



To access the cluster from Your machine do the following:
1. Replace the certificates path with tha actual data and add -data to the end of each field for example certificate-authority: would become certificate-authority-data:
Also, use the output of the following commmand to populate the corresponding field 
cat ca.crt | base64 -w 0 ; echo 
cat client.key | base64 -w 0 ; echo
cat client.crt | base64 -w 0 ; echo 
2- Change the value of server field to "https://public_IP_of_ec2:49154"
3- Replace the kubeconfig file with this file
